# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, all implemented in Python.

## 2024
Each challenge is organized into a dedicated folder named after the challenge number and title. Inside each folder, you'll find two Python files:

1. **human.py** - Contains solutions manually crafted by a human.
2. **llm.py** - Contains solutions generated by a LLM (GPT-4o mini).

The purpose of separating these files is to facilitate a comparison between human-written and LLM-generated solutions. This distinction not only highlights that human solutions may not always be optimal but also provides insights into the strengths and limitations of code produced by large language models. Understanding these differences can enhance our comprehension of problem-solving strategies.
